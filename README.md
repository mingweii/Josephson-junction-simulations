# Josephson-junction-simulations
Resistively Shunted Junction (RSJ) Simulations for overdamped Josephson junctions with peculiar current-phase relations, primarily for time-reversal symmetry breaking Josephson effect in SnTe nanowires (preprint on [arXiv:1907.04199](https://arxiv.org/abs/1907.04199)).
Codes for DC Josephson effect, Shapiro diagram, phase dynamics, and critical current extraction are included.
